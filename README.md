## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src/solutions`: the folder to maintain your source code. Note that this should be the only directory you edit.
  - To prevent version control issues, STRICTLY follow the instructions in each problemset's instruction file.
- `src/tests`: the folder for all test cases
